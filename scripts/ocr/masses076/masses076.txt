Believing this action to be in excess of the Con-     _ - stitutional authority granted you, and in violation of the fundamental tenets of democracy, we, the _       undersigned citizens of the United States, respectfully urge the immediate repeal of the present Con~ r -     '   scription Law. In justification of our position we call attention to the following facts,         First: There was never afforded to the American people any opportunity of .deciding for themselves A   A .     I , whether or not this nation should enter the European war. And such expressions of the popular will     _i,      as have been afforded, fail to substantiate the belief that conscription for such a war would be a âvol~ I i   A   5    unteering of thenation an mussel.â To wit: _ _   _ _   . s   i _         The first national expression of popular feeling was the approval of President   I A c  2         Wilsonâs course in keeping us out of war, shown by his re-election upon the slogan, âI-Ie 2 _ s        kept us out of war.â .     i, . , of     A A x   A ostal card referendum of 20,000 voters taken in the State of Massachusetts     sin.

I _    .   _ 1 In a vote taken in the county of Sheboygan, Wis., outside the city of Sheboygan, g        _ 2,051 voted against war, and not one vote was cast for war.

'       Five congressional districts east and west, city and country, circularized by their _     P congressmen at the expense of the American Union Against Militarism, voted by heavy A A   I ar _,,s ,     _ _ majorities against going to war. A manufacturing district in Pennsylvania voted 10 to 1   -      , t-e     _ _ against war. A mining and fruit-growing district in Colorado voted 6 to 1 against war.   A _ if  tj A The rural and small town~ population in a Missouri district voted 11 to 1 against war. i f  .     An a ricultural district in Texas voted ll to 1a ainst war.

Cf the nine and a half million men that did    register, fully 69 per cent. claimed exemption.  The government has refused to make public the percent-   .`   .age of those claiming exemption on the ground that they disapproved of the war, and in the absenceiof    s. , evidence which would doubtless be forthcoming if it existed, the presumption mustbe that it is so great .     . ~ as to indicate that conscription is disapproved of by a very large proportion of those actually concerned.     ~~ I . . I i. . ~ . . 'c .     ' _ Second: The conscription of an unwilling nation would not only give a tacit endorsement to the 5     c   ._._plans of the imperialistic elements in Great Britain, France, Italy and autocratic japan, endanger the â         e P republican institutions of Russia and China, alienate the sympathies of the liberals in Germany and weaken    e   A their power of resistance to their own imperialism, but it would cast doubt on thei sincerity of the          motives 'of the United States in entering into this war. VV e who share the democratic ideals set forth ' A 2       W by our President, cannot but believe that thepresent Conscription Law constitutes a fatal abandonment   A         , ,, It c _ .ofthose ideals. In the interests of that democracy of which the American people have made youthe `       _ A I   guardians, we ask the immediate repeal of the present Conscr1ptioncLaw. . ,    â A  ame ._ ..................... ; .......   ........... .........

Â§The others are saying it to hide their Ignorance of what is really behind prohibition,    or because they havenât the Courage to tell the Truth. ,   l i What is the Truth? T Â§That the basis of the prohibition movement is an artificial public sentiment created Â§by False Statements as to the injurious effects of the use of alcoholic beverages.  ~ To understand prohibition, we must know what are the Sources of its Strength. P  These are-: j   1 Â§j l. The belief that evils resulting from the excessive use of - Â§  liquor can be cured by prohibitory laws.   j Â§ Â§   W Z. The superficial thinking that confuses Cause with Co- a Â§ Â§   ' incident, and blames liquor drinking for conditions of which it is gf Â§ ~ A merely a_ Symptom.   I Â§ Â§   3. The Cowardice of weaklings who want the government Â§Â§     e to protect them against their own lack of Self-Control. i s E ~ Â§   4. The attitude of Privileged Interests that wish the people E PÂ§ to believe that liquor drinking is responsible for poverty, ignorance,   Â§ Â§ long hours, low wages, child labor, and other social evils.     QÂ§   5. The widespread systematic campaign of misleading and in- Â§ Â§   vented statistics, and gross exaggeration of the injurious effects of g I _Â§ ' liquor, conducted by Professional Reformers. T     Ã© j _ 6_. Ambition of politicians for Power and Profit, through g Â§ p agitation of the liquor question.   i ' ' Â§Â§ â The Anti-Saloon League has an Annual Income of about $2,500,000.     _Â§   Where does this enormous campaign fund come from?   " l Â§Â§ A part from misguided people who think that they are furthering the worthy cause Â§ IÂ§ of temperance. I f     E Â§ The greater part from the Privileged Interests, that are trying to divert public Â§ Â§ attention from unjust economic conditions by raising the false issue of suppressing the Â§ Â§ liquor traffic. p   j P s T   Â§-P The advocates of prohibition have manufactured public sentiment by Deliberate   Â§ Misrepresentations, and Unfounded Assertions. q     They dare not tell the people the truth as to the failure of prohibitory legislation to   Â§   Diminish Drinking. M     " "   EÂ§ Nor do they dare to enact laws forbidding the Use of liquor.   E All that they do is to prohibit its Manufacture and Sale. t ' _ E Â§ Why is not the âUseâ of liquor prohibited. '   I   P     Because a law forthat purpose Could Not Possibly Be Enforced, owing to the E nE ease with which those desiring liquors could manufacture them for their own use. E      j   E Why do not newspaper editors expose the fallacies of prohibition? p E  Either because they are too indolent to study the problem, or because they are afraid Q Â§_ l E to criticise the powerful interests that are using prohibition as a means of side-tracking the ,_ Â§ j E movement for Social Justice.
