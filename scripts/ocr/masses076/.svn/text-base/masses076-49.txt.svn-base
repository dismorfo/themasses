Â§The others are saying it to hide their Ignorance of what is really behind prohibition,    or because they havenât the Courage to tell the Truth. ,   l i What is the Truth? T Â§That the basis of the prohibition movement is an artificial public sentiment created Â§by False Statements as to the injurious effects of the use of alcoholic beverages.  ~ To understand prohibition, we must know what are the Sources of its Strength. P  These are-: j   1 Â§j l. The belief that evils resulting from the excessive use of - Â§  liquor can be cured by prohibitory laws.   j Â§ Â§   W Z. The superficial thinking that confuses Cause with Co- a Â§ Â§   ' incident, and blames liquor drinking for conditions of which it is gf Â§ ~ A merely a_ Symptom.   I Â§ Â§   3. The Cowardice of weaklings who want the government Â§Â§     e to protect them against their own lack of Self-Control. i s E ~ Â§   4. The attitude of Privileged Interests that wish the people E PÂ§ to believe that liquor drinking is responsible for poverty, ignorance,   Â§ Â§ long hours, low wages, child labor, and other social evils.     QÂ§   5. The widespread systematic campaign of misleading and in- Â§ Â§   vented statistics, and gross exaggeration of the injurious effects of g I _Â§ ' liquor, conducted by Professional Reformers. T     Ã© j _ 6_. Ambition of politicians for Power and Profit, through g Â§ p agitation of the liquor question.   i ' ' Â§Â§ â The Anti-Saloon League has an Annual Income of about $2,500,000.     _Â§   Where does this enormous campaign fund come from?   " l Â§Â§ A part from misguided people who think that they are furthering the worthy cause Â§ IÂ§ of temperance. I f     E Â§ The greater part from the Privileged Interests, that are trying to divert public Â§ Â§ attention from unjust economic conditions by raising the false issue of suppressing the Â§ Â§ liquor traffic. p   j P s T   Â§-P The advocates of prohibition have manufactured public sentiment by Deliberate   Â§ Misrepresentations, and Unfounded Assertions. q     They dare not tell the people the truth as to the failure of prohibitory legislation to   Â§   Diminish Drinking. M     " "   EÂ§ Nor do they dare to enact laws forbidding the Use of liquor.   E All that they do is to prohibit its Manufacture and Sale. t ' _ E Â§ Why is not the âUseâ of liquor prohibited. '   I   P     Because a law forthat purpose Could Not Possibly Be Enforced, owing to the E nE ease with which those desiring liquors could manufacture them for their own use. E      j   E Why do not newspaper editors expose the fallacies of prohibition? p E  Either because they are too indolent to study the problem, or because they are afraid Q Â§_ l E to criticise the powerful interests that are using prohibition as a means of side-tracking the ,_ Â§ j E movement for Social Justice.
