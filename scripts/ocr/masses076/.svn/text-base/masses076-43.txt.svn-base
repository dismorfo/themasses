Believing this action to be in excess of the Con-     _ - stitutional authority granted you, and in violation of the fundamental tenets of democracy, we, the _       undersigned citizens of the United States, respectfully urge the immediate repeal of the present Con~ r -     '   scription Law. In justification of our position we call attention to the following facts,         First: There was never afforded to the American people any opportunity of .deciding for themselves A   A .     I , whether or not this nation should enter the European war. And such expressions of the popular will     _i,      as have been afforded, fail to substantiate the belief that conscription for such a war would be a âvol~ I i   A   5    unteering of thenation an mussel.â To wit: _ _   _ _   . s   i _         The first national expression of popular feeling was the approval of President   I A c  2         Wilsonâs course in keeping us out of war, shown by his re-election upon the slogan, âI-Ie 2 _ s        kept us out of war.â .     i, . , of     A A x   A ostal card referendum of 20,000 voters taken in the State of Massachusetts     sin. P ` . V ` \ Â» yiâ e     showed 66 per cent. against war. . ~   p   ,if   _ _ In the city of Sheboygan, Wis., a referendum taken of the qualified electors resulted _     1 in a vote of 4,082 against war and 17 for war. I _    .   _ 1 In a vote taken in the county of Sheboygan, Wis., outside the city of Sheboygan, g        _ 2,051 voted against war, and not one vote was cast for war.     A     ,irp   , _ A straw vote inthe city of Seattle, Wash., showed 374 against a declarationof war   r I  , 5     A   _ . and 31 for it. , _ 2 I   ec,t     6 â   I A referendum taken by Congressman Lundeen of his constituents in the city of     ,     â ~' . . . _ _ . . - ,           _ _ Minneapolis, Minn., brought returns from nearly 8,000 voters against declaring war, and 1 ~ _       from less than 300 in favor of such a declaration. _ _ . '       Five congressional districts east and west, city and country, circularized by their _     P congressmen at the expense of the American Union Against Militarism, voted by heavy A A   I ar _,,s ,     _ _ majorities against going to war. A manufacturing district in Pennsylvania voted 10 to 1   -      , t-e     _ _ against war. A mining and fruit-growing district in Colorado voted 6 to 1 against war.   A _ if  tj A The rural and small town~ population in a Missouri district voted 11 to 1 against war. i f  .     An a ricultural district in Texas voted ll to 1a ainst war. Thirt con ressmen re - I   ,   * i e r     _ _ _ _ _ _Y 8Â° Â» P   is c       resentmg all sections of the country, reached through lists furnished mostly by or- t   2         ganized labor and the granges, reported a vote running uniformly against war.           if 'A A The one opportunity for the expression of the popular feeling concerning the Conscription Law-~? ,       namely, registration of all men between the ages of 21 and 31--appears to show that fully one million     ,   . men expressed their disapproval by refusing to register. Cf the nine and a half million men that did    register, fully 69 per cent. claimed exemption.  The government has refused to make public the percent-   .`   .age of those claiming exemption on the ground that they disapproved of the war, and in the absenceiof    s. , evidence which would doubtless be forthcoming if it existed, the presumption mustbe that it is so great .     . ~ as to indicate that conscription is disapproved of by a very large proportion of those actually concerned.     ~~ I . . I i. . ~ . . 'c .     ' _ Second: The conscription of an unwilling nation would not only give a tacit endorsement to the 5     c   ._._plans of the imperialistic elements in Great Britain, France, Italy and autocratic japan, endanger the â         e P republican institutions of Russia and China, alienate the sympathies of the liberals in Germany and weaken    e   A their power of resistance to their own imperialism, but it would cast doubt on thei sincerity of the          motives 'of the United States in entering into this war. VV e who share the democratic ideals set forth ' A 2       W by our President, cannot but believe that thepresent Conscription Law constitutes a fatal abandonment   A         , ,, It c _ .ofthose ideals. In the interests of that democracy of which the American people have made youthe `       _ A I   guardians, we ask the immediate repeal of the present Conscr1ptioncLaw. . ,    â A  ame ._ ..................... ; .......   ........... .........
