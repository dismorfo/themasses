This splendid picture by Robert Robinson gives _ _an 1nt1mate glimpse of one of the younger scholars in that remarkable institution. iV The only drawback to the School of Experience lies in the fact that the course of l_` study kills off the greater percentage of the pupils. But d1e or live the pupil learns' the bitter realities of life and is granted plenty of long hours to puzzle over its prob- _E lems. To the boys and younger men employed in mines or engaged in other danger- _     ous and wearisome work Socialism comes as a revelation. It answers the questions 1   they have never solved and declares the meaning of the facts of Experience. Best of     all, it points The Way Out.   be Â» T 5 lr ' Y 1 __s "  [E â 4   _VV V
