I2, liLouis Untermeyer  OFTEN wish that I had been alive The grotesque monkey-folk, the angel-fish,  Ere God grew old; before His eyes were tired That make the oceanâs depth a visual heaven; _z  Â» Of the eternal circlings of the sun, _ The animals like plants, the plants like beasts;   p Of the perpetual Springs, the weary years The loud, inane_hyena; and the great TForever marching on an unknown quest, Impossible giraffe, whose silly head Q The yawning seasons pacing to and fro Threatens the stars, his feet embracing earth. , , Like stolid sentinels to guard the earth. The paradox of the peacock, who-se bright form _ I wish that I had been alive when He Is like a brilliant trumpet, and his voice _l V\7as still delighted with each casual thing A strident squawk, a cackle and a joke. â _ 1 His mind could fashion, when His soul first thrilled The ostrich, like a snake tied to a bird, J = With childlike pleasure at the blooming sun; All out of sense and drawing, Wilder far f S \Vhen the first dawn met His enraptured eyes _ . Than all the mad, fantastic thoughts of men. I And the first prayers of men stirred in His heart. The hump-backed camel, like a lump of clay,\7Vith what a glow of pride He heard the stars Thumbed at for hours, and then thrown aside.Rush by Him, singing, as they bravely leaped The elephant, with splendid useless tooth, Into the unexplored and endless skies, And nose and arm and fingers all in one. Bearing His beauty like a battle-cry; The hippopotamus, absurd and bland-Or watched the light, obedient to His will, Oh, how God must have laughed when first He saw T Spring out of nothingness to answer Him, These great jests breathe and live and walk about! FHurling strange suns and planets in its joy And how the heavens must have echoed him ..... _ i Of fiery freedom from the lifeless dark. For, greater than His beauty or His wrathBut more than all the splendid worlds He made, Was Godâs vast mirth before His back was bent The elements new-tamed, the harnessed winds; W'ith Time and all the troubling universe; i ln spite of these it must have pleased Him most Ere He grew dull and weary with creating ....To feel Himself branch out, let go, dare all, i Oh, to have been alive and heard that laughGive utterance to His vaguely-formed desires ; i Thrilling the stars and shattering the earth, Let loose a fiood of fancies, wild and frank. 'While meteors fiashed from out His sparkling eyes, s Oh, those were noble times; those gay attempts, And even the eternal placid Night _ Those vast and droll experiments that were made Forgot to lift 1`â¬PâI`0ViUÂ§ fingers, smiledWhen God was young and blithe and whimsical. And joined, indulgent in the merriment. 'When from the infinite humor of His heart, And how they sang, and how the hours flew. He made the elk with such extravagant horns, V\7hen God was young and blithe and whimsical. ~ I _ Ml / ,/7/ ,./Q V. __   J. / /âTl ~ ~ J     ; i \_   /4   _7/ f_    âIl Damned _  âi t Wlllinm 5'   * S ml U E/s tryinff to break up the Hemelâ T 1 Ti ,,.   _ \' â_ 1 " âl_"~ I     _ T _5% mÂ¢\nm\Â¢; f   ~ H Get if? p,_ =   _V   /~Q Tâ 5- in il Thatâs the secret: thatâs the Big League shortstop ,  _ 5'   r ifgl _liâ thatâs always ready to stop short anybody who starts_  i  '?â   A  ?
