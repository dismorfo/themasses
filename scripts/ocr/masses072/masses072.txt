To furtherf this end we offer large sumsiof the American peopleÂ°s moneys (now in the Treasury A .1   at Washington) to heal and repair the ravages of the last two and a hal'f years of ptA war, realizing our shareof the blame for :these calamities by our previous lack of 1  warmth in our .efforts of prevention.     â-p     WANTED: Sons and Daughters of at Living Revolution.
