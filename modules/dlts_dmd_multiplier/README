To use this module:

1. Configure and save an action.

go to admin/config/system/actions
In the "Create An Advanced Action" dropdown (all the way at the bottom), select "DLTS: Populate DMD based on a chosen source node and fields"
Click "Create"

On the form, enter a label for your action, select a source node, and select which fields to use. 
	Unselected fields will not be affected in the target node.

Save your Action.

2. Create a Target Set using Views.

In the Views interface, build a view that captures your target nodes (their DMD will be populated from the source node).
	Give your view a path in the /admin tree
	Use Fields
	Use Format: Table
	Include a field for "Bulk operations" - this is a checkbox provided by the views_bulk_operations module.
		Configure the field to enable the action you created in step 1.
		* Note: If you edit your action, you will need to re-add it to the list of allowed actions in the view field. *
	
3. Go to your view and run the action.
	
	
	

TO DO:

*Right now, this module is hardcoded for the 'dlts_book' content type. In the next iteration, it would be good to make
content type a selector on the config page, and to use Drupal form states to have the Source Node and Source Field options
dynamically appear after the user selects a content type. Then this module would be usable on any content type.

*Create documentation and adjust the permissions so that end users (site curators, metadata experts) can use the module themselves.

*Some fields (identifier, handle, etc.) should never be overwritten this way. Right now, there is a sanitizer in the module that has some 
hardcoded exclusions. In the long run, it would be better if this information could be stored with the content type definitions.

*Add an option to the configuration page (checkbox):
	Overwrite target fields if they are already populated?
